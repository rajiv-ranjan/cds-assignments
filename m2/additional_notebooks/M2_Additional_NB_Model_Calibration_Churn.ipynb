In binary classification, an uncalibrated model's output, such as 0.4 for predicting a dog, cannot be interpreted directly as a probability. Calibration ensures that if the model outputs 0.4, then ideally, 4 out of 10 such predictions would indeed be dogs. This process aligns the model's predicted probabilities with actual outcomes, making them more interpretable and reliable.\n","\n","**When to calibrate models and why it is critical?**\n","\n","Calibration is vital for applications where accurate probability estimates are crucial, such as predicting fire alarms. For an uncalibrated model, a prediction score of 0.9 does not reliably indicate that a fire is three times more likely than a score of 0.3. Calibration ensures these scores can be interpreted correctly, allowing for informed decision-making.\n","\n","For example, if improving a fire detection system costs $200,000, a calibrated model helps determine whether a change in prediction scores (from 0.3 to 0.35 and 0.9 to 0.7) justifies the investment. Without calibration, these scores lack meaningful interpretation, making it difficult to assess potential gains accurately.\n","\n","Model calibration is particularly important in production environments where models are continually improved through learning and feedback. Accurate probability estimates enable better risk assessment, resource allocation, and overall decision-making, ensuring the model's outputs are reliable and actionable."],"metadata":{"id":"_JxgBdy2YjDJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Description\n","\n","**The Customer Churn** table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California for Q2 2022.\n","\n","This dataset contains 2 tables, in CSV format:\n","\n","Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!\n","The Zip Code Population table contains complimentary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table"],"metadata":{"id":"Jr7kgJupX9fx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mYMip47REuce"},"outputs":[],"source":["!mkdir ~/.kaggle\n","!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/\n","!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title Download the Dataset\n","!wget https://cdn.exec.talentsprint.com/static/cds/content/telecom_customer_churn_by_maven_analytics.zip\n","!unzip /content/telecom_customer_churn_by_maven_analytics.zip\n","print(\"The datset was downloaded\")"],"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"Xn1KSlGiI9E9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"T2b_WCBjYpfJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install ml_insights -q"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import required packages"],"metadata":{"id":"ifpRkR8SKEWq"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"27McswWDYe-J"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import ml_insights as mli\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import lightgbm as lgbm\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import log_loss, roc_auc_score, f1_score\n","from sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load data"],"metadata":{"id":"Fp-5hVplJ09M"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8qe39q7TY-Uz"},"outputs":[],"source":["data = pd.read_csv('/content/telecom_customer_churn.csv')\n","data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_Ga0u9QlZCpt"},"outputs":[],"source":["data.info()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"U4uOhBb1ZLBZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["data = data.iloc[:,[1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12,15,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eO8D8Vy6wMLk"},"outputs":[],"source":["data = data[data['Customer Status']!='Joined'].reset_index(drop=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bD-keaGoyACy"},"outputs":[],"source":["data['Customer Status'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ugBWvIVsxsy4"},"outputs":[],"source":["data['Customer Status'] = data['Customer Status'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x=='Churned' else 0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"CH_2j1jiyArb"},"outputs":[],"source":["data['Customer Status'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6wHLa1nRuxNa"},"outputs":[],"source":["data.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Ho_NPaU7xEX8"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Extract categoricals and their indices\n","cat_features = data.select_dtypes(exclude=np.number).columns.to_list()\n","cat_idx = [data.columns.get_loc(col) for col in cat_features]\n","\n","# Convert cat_features to pd.Categorical dtype\n","for col in cat_features:\n","    data[col] = pd.Categorical(data[col])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"iskCiU4vv8Ll"},"outputs":[],"source":["data.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UmzqSwpGNBNq"},"source":["## Splitting the data"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Set the percentage splits for the training, validation, and test datasets\n","train_perc = 0.4\n","val_perc = 0.3\n","test_perc = 0.3\n","\n","# Set the random seed for reproducibility\n","rs = 1234\n","\n","# Split the data into a combined training/validation set and a test set\n","# 'test_size=test_perc' means 30% of the data will be assigned to the test set\n","# 'random_state=rs' ensures the split is reproducible\n","# 'stratify=data.iloc[:,-1]' ensures the split maintains the same proportion of classes as in the original data\n","X_train_val, X_test, y_train_val, y_test = train_test_split(\n","    data.iloc[:, :-1],  #

Now for each bin calculate the absolute difference between the values calculated in step 3 and step 2and multiply this absolute difference by the number of data points in that bin.\n","3. Add the results for all bins calculated in step 4 and normalize this added sum by the total number of samples in all the bins.\n","\n","The ECE quantifies the overall calibration error by averaging the absolute differences between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, weighted by the number of samples in each bin. The OE focuses on the specific error due to overconfidence by only considering cases where the predicted probability exceeds the actual accuracy.\n","\n","### Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n","\n","The Expected Calibration Error (ECE) measures the discrepancy between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. It is calculated as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{ECE} = \\sum_{m=1}^M \\frac{|B_m|}{n} \\left| \\text{acc}(B_m) - \\text{conf}(B_m) \\right|\n","$$\n","\n","### Overconfidence Error (OE)\n","\n","The Overconfidence Error (OE) measures the degree to which the model's predicted probabilities are overconfident compared to actual outcomes. It is calculated as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{OE} = \\sum_{m=1}^M \\frac{|B_m|}{n} \\cdot \\text{conf}(B_m) \\cdot \\max(\\text{conf}(B_m) - \\text{acc}(B_m), 0)\n","$$\n","\n","\n","However, in our case above, the distribution of the data points across the bins was not very uniform (since most data points belonged to the first bin) and thus it is imperative to select the bins for ECE accordingly. We can see how the number of bins is directly affecting ECE in the algorithm.\n","\n","**For instance for only 5 bins, the uncalibrated model seemed to have lesser calibration error than all the other methods. However when we increase the number of bins, we can see that model calibration has actually helped in our case.**\n","\n","In the code snippets below, this effect can be verified.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Define a function to calculate calibration error\n","def calibration_error(y_true, y_prob, n_bins=5, strategy='uniform', return_expected_calibration_error=True):\n","    # Determine the bin edges based on the chosen strategy\n","    if strategy == 'quantile':  # Determine bin edges by distribution of data\n","        quantiles = np.linspace(0, 1, n_bins + 1)  # Create quantiles\n","        bins = np.percentile(y_prob, quantiles * 100)  # Determine bin edges based on percentiles\n","        bins[-1] = bins[-1] + 1e-8  # Ensure the last bin edge is slightly larger to include the maximum value\n","    elif strategy == 'uniform':  # Use uniform binning\n","        bins = np.linspace(0., 1. + 1e-8, n_bins + 1)  # Create uniform bins\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Invalid entry to 'strategy' input.
