XGBoost is available in Python, R, Java, Ruby, Swift, Julia, C, and C++. Similar to LightGBM, XGBoost uses the gradients of different cuts to select the next cut, but XGBoost also uses the hessian, or second derivative, in its ranking of cuts. Computing this next derivative comes at a slight cost, but it also allows a greater estimation of the cut to use.\n","\n","**CatBoost** is developed and maintained by the Russian search engine Yandex and is available in Python, R, C++, Java, and also Rust. CatBoost distinguishes itself from LightGBM and XGBoost by focusing on optimizing decision trees for categorical variables, or variables whose different values may have no relation with each other (eg. apples and oranges).\n","\n","**LightGBM** is a boosting technique and framework developed by Microsoft. The framework implements the LightGBM algorithm and is available in Python, R, and C. LightGBM is unique in that it can construct trees using Gradient-Based One-Sided Sampling, or GOSS for short.\n","\n","To know more on comparisons between CatBoost, XgBoost and LightGBM, refer below\n","- [Article 1](https://cdn.iisc.talentsprint.com/CDS/Assignments/Module2/catboost%20vs%20lightgbm%20vs%20xgboost.pdf)\n","- [Article 2](https://cdn.iisc.talentsprint.com/CDS/Assignments/Module2/catboost%20lightgbm%20xgboost%202.pdf)"],"metadata":{"id":"X50WsN2yl9kh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Description\n","\n","Lending Club is a lending platform that lends money to people in need at an interest rate based on their credit history and other factors.
