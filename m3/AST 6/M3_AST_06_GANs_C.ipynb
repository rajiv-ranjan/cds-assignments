We can think of the random inputs as the latent representations (i.e., codings) of the image to be generated. So, as we can see, the generator offers the same functionality as a decoder in a variational autoencoder, and it can be used in the same way to generate new images (just feed it some Gaussian noise, and it outputs a brand-new image).\n","\n","**Discriminator**\n","\n","Takes either a fake image from the generator or a real image from the training set as input, and must guess whether the input image is fake or real.\n","\n","![Image](https://i.ibb.co/NWJx90f/M5-4.jpg)\n","\n","$\\text{Figure 1: A generative adversarial network}$\n","\n","During training, the generator and the discriminator have opposite goals: the discriminator tries to tell fake images from real images, while the generator tries to produce images that look real enough to trick the discriminator. Since, the GAN is composed of two networks with different objectives, it cannot be trained like a regular neural network and its training iteration is divided into two phases:\n","\n","* In the first phase, we train the *discriminator*. A batch of real images is sampled from the training set and is completed with an equal number of fake images produced by the generator. The labels are set to 0 for fake images and 1 for real images, and the discriminator is trained on this labeled batch for one step, using the binary cross-entropy loss.\n","\n","* In the second phase, we train the *generator*. We first use it to produce another batch of fake images, and once again the discriminator is used to tell whether the images are fake or real. This time we do not add real images in the batch, and all the labels are set to 1 (real): in other words, we want the generator to produce images that the discriminator will (wrongly) believe to be real.\n","\n","To know more about GANs, click

It's important that the generator and discriminator do not overpower each other (e.g., that they train at a similar rate).\n","\n","At the beginning of the training, the generated images look like random noise. As training progresses, the generated digits will look increasingly real. After about 50 epochs, they resemble MNIST digits.

In fact, DCGANs can learn quite meaningful latent representation. As we can see in Figure 2 below: many images were generated, and nine of them were picked manually (top left), including three representing men with glasses, three men without glasses, and three women without glasses. For each of these categories, the codings that were used to generate the images were averaged, and an image was generated based on the resulting mean codings (lower left). In short, each of the three lower-left images represents the mean of the three images located above it. But this is not a simple mean computed at the pixel level (this would result in three overlapping faces), it is a mean computed in the latent space, so the images still look like normal faces. Amazingly, if we compute men with glasses, minus men without glasses, plus women without glasses—where each term corresponds to one of the mean codings and we generate the image that corresponds to this coding, we get the image at the center of the 3 × 3 grid of faces on the right: a woman with glasses.\n","    \n","![Image](https://i.ibb.co/tBhgNmF/M5-5.jpg)\n","\n","${\\text{Figure 2: Vector arithmetic for visual concepts}}$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-pF1wP_-qmaS"},"source":["Most improvement has been made to discriminator models in an effort to train more effective generator models, although less effort has been put into improving the generator models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6d7aoNMcqmaT"},"source":["### Theory Questions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JpRvrzLsqmaU"},"source":["1. Can you name few tasks where GANs can shine?\n","\n","Answer:\n","\n","**1. GANs for Image Editing**\n","\n","Using GANs, we can reconstruct images and attempt to change the appearance drastically.\n","\n","![Image](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Example-of-Face-Photo-Editing-with-IcGAN-1024x276.png)\n","\n","**2. Using GANs for Security**\n","\n","A constant concern of industrial applications is that they should be robust to cyber attacks. GANs are proving to be of immense help here, directly addressing the concern of “adversarial attacks”.\n","\n","These adversarial attacks use a variety of techniques to fool deep learning architectures. GANs are used to make existing deep learning models more robust to these techniques. How? By creating more such fake examples and training the model to identify them. A technique called SSGAN is used to do steganalysis of images and detect harmful encodings which shouldn’t have been there.\n","\n","**3. Generating Data with GANs**\n","\n","GANs shine again as they can be used to generate synthetic data for supervision. We know where to go next time we need more data.\n","\n","You can refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07828.pdf) to explore the creation of synthetic data with the help of GANs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VfI6lQESqmaV"},"source":["2. What are the main difficulties when training GANs?\n","\n","Answer: It would seem that you just need to train the GAN for long enough, and it will eventually reach this equilibrium, giving you a perfect generator. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple: nothing guarantees that the equilibrium will ever be reached.\n","\n","* The biggest difficulty is called mode collapse: this is when the generator’s outputs gradually become less diverse. How can this happen? Suppose that the generator gets better at producing convincing shoes than any other class. It will fool the discriminator a bit more with shoes, and this will encourage it to produce even more images of shoes. Gradually, it will forget how to produce anything else. Meanwhile, the only fake images that the discriminator will see will be shoes, so it will also forget how to discriminate fake images of other classes. Eventually, when the discriminator manages to discriminate the fake shoes from the real ones, the generator will be forced to move to another class. It may then become good at shirts, forgetting about shoes, and the discriminator will follow. The GAN may gradually cycle across a few classes, never really becoming very good at any of them.\n","\n","* Moreover, because the generator and the discriminator are constantly pushing against each other, their parameters may end up oscillating and becoming unstable. Training may begin properly, then suddenly diverge for no apparent reason, due to these instabilities. And since many factors affect these complex dynamics, GANs are very sensitive to the hyperparameters: you may have to spend a lot of effort fine-tuning them.\n","\n","In short, this is still a very active field of research, and the dynamics of GANs are still not perfectly understood.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wzV-CLR_sfsw"},"source":["### Please answer the questions below to complete the experiment:\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n_rU0QpZskf1"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title The generator uses `tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose` (upsampling) layers to produce an image from { run: \"auto\", form-width: \"500px\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","Answer = \"\" #@param [\"\", \"an array of ones\", \"an exponential function\", \"a set of finite and deterministic values\", \"a seed (random noise)\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hfAcvNI0spZl"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title How was the experiment? { run: \"auto\", form-width: \"500px\", display-mode: \"form\" }\n","Complexity = \"\" #@param [\"\",\"Too Simple, I am wasting time\", \"Good, But Not Challenging for me\", \"Good and Challenging for me\", \"Was Tough, but I did it\", \"Too Difficult for me\"]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pmkfYHR2svzE"},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title If it was too easy, what more would you have liked to be added?
