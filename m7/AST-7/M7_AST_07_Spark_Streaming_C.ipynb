This leads to a new stream processing model that is very similar to a batch processing model. We will express our streaming computation as a standard batch-like query as on a static table, and Spark runs it as an incremental query on the unbounded input table. Let’s understand this model in more detail. A query on the input will generate the “Result Table” as given in the figure below. Every trigger interval (say, every 1 second), new rows get appended to the Input Table, which eventually updates the Result Table. Whenever the result table gets updated, we would want to write the changed result rows to an external sink.\n","\n","![spark%20stream.PNG](https://cdn.iisc.talentsprint.com/CDS/Images/spark_stream.PNG)\n","\n","The “Output” is defined as what gets written out to the external storage.
